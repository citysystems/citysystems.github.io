Through screenings of world-class documentary films, expert panels, and discussions with filmmakers, it provides an innovative and structured student-centric platform for learning and engagement. Throughout the academic year, CAW presents a series of 6-7 film major screenings combined with guests and panels organized with partners across Stanford (Winter, Spring, and Summer - with the Fall quarter activities dedicated to hosting UNAFF, www.unaff.org, a renowned international documentary film festival).

In addition to these events, CAW organizes also several smaller screenings and discussions in dorms and graduate residence facilities in coordination with on-campus institutes and centers such as the Bechtel International Center, Freeman Spogli Institute and Stanford Global studies. CAW is program of Stanford Arts.
