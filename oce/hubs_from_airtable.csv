Through screenings of world-class documentary films, expert panels, and discussions with filmmakers, it provides an innovative and structured student-centric platform for learning and engagement. Throughout the academic year, CAW presents a series of 6-7 film major screenings combined with guests and panels organized with partners across Stanford (Winter, Spring, and Summer - with the Fall quarter activities dedicated to hosting UNAFF, www.unaff.org, a renowned international documentary film festival).

In addition to these events, CAW organizes also several smaller screenings and discussions in dorms and graduate residence facilities in coordination with on-campus institutes and centers such as the Bechtel International Center, Freeman Spogli Institute and Stanford Global studies. CAW is program of Stanford Arts.

The dynamic and complex nature of cities challenges traditional disciplinary boundaries, so our program is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing from fields in the social sciences, history, and education. Courses in the program focus on issues in contemporary urban society, and on the forces and practices that shape urban life. Courses also address how cities have changed over time and how they continue to change today in societies around the world. Through a comprehensive program that includes course work, community engagement, and independent research, a major in Urban Studies prepares students for careers and graduate study in fields including architecture, business, community service, education, environmental planning, law, public policy, real estate development, urban design, and urban planning.  It also prepares students to be critical thinkers, engaged citizens, and informed leaders who can help to transform cities for the better.
