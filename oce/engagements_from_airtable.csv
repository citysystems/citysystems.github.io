To help answer these and other questions about the experience of English learners, Stanford Graduate School of Education (GSE) has launched a groundbreaking research partnership with nine neighboring school districts that collectively serve more than 30,000 students in kindergarten through high school.

The Stanford-Sequoia K-12 Research Collaborative connects GSE scholars with school leaders in southern San Mateo County to research challenges the districts are facing around educating English learners (ELs).

Food insecurity is associated with poor health and decreased learning for children, and the San Joaquin Valley has some of the highest rates of food insecurity statewide. 

Our team is working with Cultiva la Salud and Dolores Huerta Foundation, two community-based organizations serving Latino immigrant families in the San Joaquin Valley. The goal is to increase children’s access to healthy and appealing food. 

Faculty and trainees at Stanford, colleagues at the Nutrition Policy Institute, and staff from both community organizations have worked with parents in six school districts to identify barriers families face in accessing school meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The team is building on this work to partner with community organizations, schools, and parents to investigate how school meals can be more effective in addressing food insecurity.""

recKXI3Y0MrRcZ7Va,Assessing Communication Impacts on Student Reading,"Ravenswood Reads is a tutoring and mentoring service-learning program at the Haas Center for Public Service. Founded in 1982, the program is a collaboration between the Haas Center, the Graduate School of Education and the Ravenswood City School District. Stanford students are taught to support the literacy development of students in kindergarten through third grade, drawing on cutting-edge Stanford research and models. Building on the in-person approach used for decades, the proposed study investigates research questions such as: Does text-message communication with teachers, parents and guardians about tutoring have an effect on children’s reading development? What kinds of communication most facilitate fruitful connections across tutoring, home and school contexts? As tutoring adapts to hybrid mode, OCE funding will support research, data analysis and materials.

We look to identify individuals that possess tenacity and drive, enthusiasm and curiosity. Prior lab experience is not a prerequisite because we recognize that some students don’t have the same opportunities as others to explore hands-on science. Passion, however, is essential: we have found that when you’re really interested in something, you’ll invest more time and energy- and with that added effort invariably comes success.

Curiosity is also important. Every scientist, entrepreneur, inventor, and creator will tell you that inquisitiveness, that willingness to think in new and different ways, is the most valuable characteristic you can possess. When it is coupled with perseverance and determination, there’s no telling what you can learn about science and medicine- and also about yourself.

recxMrGVw8gXRZWyI,Stanford Earth Young Investigators,"High school students spend the summer working in research laboratories. Students are supervised directly by graduate students, post docs and lab managers. This program enables graduate students to serve as supervisors, prepares high school students for college and helps strengthen the connections between Stanford and local high schools. Since 2004, over 300 high school students have worked in our research labs and learned about the process of science first hand.

recy1yaJARSL4sTes,SMASH-Med High School Summer Program,"Students belonging to racial/ethnic minority groups continue to be underrepresented among medical school applicants, matriculates, and graduates. While existing pipeline programs for students who are underrepresented in medicine engage them in biomedicine at the undergraduate level, efforts to promote diversity in the medical workforce may be more effective during the years from kindergarten through 12th grade. We created a summer pipeline program focused on surgery, invited participation by students from low-income high schools, and queried students’ self-efficacy, interest, and perceived barriers in this convergent mixed-methods study. Our emphasis on surgery was intended to address the lower percentage of physicians from underrepresented groups in medical subspecialties.
