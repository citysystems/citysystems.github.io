<h2 id="other-projects">Other Projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MACK, the Mobile Air Conditioning Kit</strong>: We developed a portable heat pump for emergency deployment in low-income communities, in partnership with Climate Resilient Communities, El Concilio, North Fair Oaks Community Alliance, and the University of Michigan.

  <li><strong>Sustainable San Mateo County Dashboard</strong> (<em>2024</em>): We developed a comprehensive <a href="https://sustainablesanmateo.org/sustainability-dashboard/">dashboard</a> of sustainability metrics for SSMC.

  <li><strong>ADU Look-up Tools</strong> (<em>2023</em>): Since our first tool for Napa and Sonoma Counties, we have developed additional ADU look-up tools for jurisdictions in Orange County, Los Angeles County, and Ventura County (<a href="https://housingsocal.org/address-lookup-tool/">housingsocal.org</a>), jurisdictions in Amador County, Calaveras County, Mariposa County, and Nevada County (<a href="https://motherlodeadu.org/can-i-build">motherlodeadu.org</a>), jurisdictions in Alameda County (<a href="https://www.adu.acgov.org/build/">adu.acgov.org</a>), and jurisdictions in El Dorado County (<a href="https://eldoradoadu.org/resources/contractor-list-copy/">eldoradoadu.org</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Belle Haven Environmental Justice Survey</strong> (<em>2022</em>): Supporting Climate Resilient Communities, we designed and analyzed a 400+ household survey to understand environmental justice-related disparities, particularly in the Belle Haven neighborhood, which informed the City of Menlo Park's Environmental Justice and Safety Elements. The final report can be viewed as part of the City's published materials (starting on <a href="https://menlopark.gov/files/sharedassets/public/v/1/community-development/documents/projects/housing-element-update/environmental-justice-element-20221212-public-review-draft.pdf">PDF</a> page 145), and an interactive version of the survey results can be viewed <a href="https://city.systems/app_direct/menlopark/">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Joint Venture Silicon Valley Public Company Stock Tracker</strong> (<em>2022</em>): We developed a <a href="https://siliconvalleyindicators.org/live-updates/stock-tracker/">stock tracker</a> for JVSV to support exploration of a potential future regional ETF to support investment in local place-based improvements.</li>

  <li><strong>Napa Sonoma ADU Look-up Tool</strong> (<em>2020</em>): We developed an <a href="https://napasonomaadu.org/can-i-build">address look-up tool</a> for the Napa Sonoma ADU Center’s new website that allows property owners to determine their ADU eligibility in accordance with new state laws. As local zoning ordinances continue to be updated, the Center can easily update the tool using a Google Sheet.</li>
  <li><strong>East Palo Alto ADU Policy Impact Analysis</strong> (<em>2020</em>): We assisted the City of East Palo Alto with analyzing the impacts of their ADU local ordinance update scenarios on ADU eligibility at the parcel-level.

In particular, we spearheaded the design of the systems diagram and strategy framework featured in the report.</li>
  <li><strong>East Palo Alto Garage Conversions</strong> (<em>2019</em>): We supported Rebuilding Together Peninsula in the legalization of two garages with unpermitted living spaces in East Palo Alto.

  <li><strong>Complete Communities Framework</strong>: We’re working on an open-source, data-driven method for measuring and improving the “completeness” of communities, or the ability of residents to access amenities they value within a reasonable travel time (e.g., 15 minutes), using modes they prefer.</li>
